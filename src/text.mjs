 * a module is a syntax hazard, and the entire point of the class is that these
 * characters never reach a line somebody reads. Each class forges or hides
 * something:
 *
 * - **C0** (U+0000-U+001F) and **DEL** (U+007F): a bare newline forges a whole
 *   line in the human report; the rest drive a terminal.
 * - **C1** (U+0080-U+009F): U+0085 is NEL, which begins a new line on a
 *   terminal exactly as a line feed does, and U+009B is the 8-bit CSI, which
 *   opens an escape sequence. Neither is ECMAScript whitespace and neither is
 *   escaped by `JSON.stringify`, so a sanitiser that stops at C0 lets both
 *   through to stdout intact.
 * - **U+2028 / U+2029**: they terminate a line for a JavaScript consumer.
 * - **Bidi controls** (U+200E, U+200F, U+202A-U+202E, U+2066-U+2069): U+202E
 *   reverses everything displayed after it, so a result named one thing reads as
 *   another; the isolates hide what they wrap.
